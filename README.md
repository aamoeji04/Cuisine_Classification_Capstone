## Business Problem
Build a model that can accurately classify a cuisine based on key words in a given recipe.
WHY?
Gain insights and make patterns between different cuisines through classification
Use those insights and patterns to generate novel, possibly delicious recipes


## Data
The data used for this classification project was scrapped and concatenated from 2 different websites, both of which are affilitated with [British Croadcasting Corporation](https://www.bbc.com/). 900 recipes were collected in total from [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/category/all-cuisines) and [BBC Food](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/cuisines). 

When we first take a look at our data, we can see the distribution of class that we have.

From the bar graph above, we can clearly see that a majority of our data consists of mexican recipes and comparitavelty there is a severe lack of caribbean recipes. Through further exploratory data analysis, we can generate more insights about our data.
